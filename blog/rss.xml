            <title>A Small Shout-Out to My Students</title>
            <link>https://bartdelrue.github.io/blog#small-shout-out-to-my-students</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
        This semester, a group of students in the <strong>web topics advanced</strong> elective explored
        <em>linked data</em>, <em>federated web</em>, <em>ActivityPub</em>, <em>Webmention</em>, and <em>Solid</em>.
        They also experimented with tools such as <em>three.js</em>, <em>cables.gl</em>, and <em>TouchDesigner</em>
        to create interactive media projects.
        LinkedIn-style boasting isnâ€™t my strong suit, but Iâ€™m very proud of the work theyâ€™ve done.
        I invited them to Courtray for the <a href="https://wonderkortrijk.be/">Wonder creativity festival</a>,
        to <a href="https://www.kbr.be/">KBR</a> in Brussels to meet Sven Lieber, and to the Wintercircus Ghent for
        a talk about TouchDesigner.

            <description><![CDATA[
        As is tradition in January, Iâ€™ve curated a small list of good intentions for 2025.
        The basic fit will probably be saturated with other well-intentioned people... so Iâ€™ll avoid getting in their way.
        Whatâ€™s left is a very real desire to share at least one observation with the world through this blog.
        And yes, I antedated this post so the one above wouldnâ€™t look lonely. Please donâ€™t tell anyone. ðŸ˜‰
